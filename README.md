# MetaTrader5 Weekly

Program Files for MT5 Desktop for usage as the base of a Docker Image for CI/CD.

## Why?

MT5 has live updates and it is hard to track updates and standardize them. This Repository serves as a weekly release of any update MetaQuotes deploys for MT5.

This also provides a way to roll back if any new updates fail our CI/CD pipeline.

It also contains all the servers for all brokerages Finautica uses.
